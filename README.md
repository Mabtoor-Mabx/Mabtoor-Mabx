# **Personal Projects:**

## ðŸ”¥Emily - The AI Virtual Assistant
Emily is a voice-controlled AI virtual assistant built using Python. It can perform various tasks such as providing real-time weather updates, fetching Nobel Prize information, reading top news headlines, and opening popular websites. Emily uses speech recognition for voice input and text-to-speech technology for audio responses, creating an interactive and hands-free experience

## ðŸ”¥ Calculator With Saved History Using Python
The Calculator With Saved History Using Python is a simple command-line application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
One of the key features of this project is the ability to save calculation history to a file (history.txt) and retrieve it later. Users can also clear the history when needed, making it a practical and lightweight tool for everyday calculations.

## ðŸ”¥ Password_Guessing_Game_Using_Python
The Password Guessing Game is a fun and interactive Python-based project where users try to guess a randomly selected password. The game allows players to choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Based on the selected difficulty, the game picks a password from predefined lists and provides hints to assist the player in guessing the correct password.
